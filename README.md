# Challenge #OneCode21Days Accepted. 

### What's new?
* **We get a mentor.**
* **It's Pair Coding!**
* **It's easy.**
* **We have a smaller time period.**
* **It helps in starting [Open Source Contributions](https://www.quora.com/What-really-is-open-source-contribution)**

### Why this challenge? 
All big companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon, Paytm, BookMyShow etc, they all have one requirement in common and that is requirement for knowledge of Algorithms. One can learn languages and frameworks for development to showcase in their resume but they still ask for Algorithms.

I have suffered enough due to lack of knowledge and I want to start a challenge where I choose one partner and we both code daily for 1 hour. And then I review his code and he reviews mine (he is just a referece to my friend, it could have been a  she!).  We add comments in each other's code as to where it could have been better. We also need to add a new learning each day for 21 days.

### Why is it different from other challenges?
* Its brings Pair Programming concept with a new twist.
* We all become mentors.
* It is easier to commit to.
* It does not take much time.
* You do not focus much on sharing and posting and logging
. Just code and show progress.

### Why 21 days?
No, it does not take 21 days to break an old habit. And no it does not take 100 days to break a habit. Generally it can vary the amount depending upon a person. But to change a habit, following a 100 days pattern is quite difficult and it easily breaks. Sometimes we need to go somewhere and think to cover it up later. And sometimes we miss it casually, thinking one day won't effect us. 

**The need is to go straight for a predecided amount of time and without a break.** So this is why I chose 21 days. It is easier and we can code for 1 hour. 


### What do we get?
* We lear how to code algorithms. 
* We get a friend as a mentor. 
* We learn how to code with good practices.
* We lose the fear of coding, if any.
* We can aim for bigger companies.
* Less Imposter Syndrome.
* Doing alogorithms alone is tiresome and you can get stuck in between.
* We learn so much.
* We cut the competition nature of practice. We bring in a learning nature.
* We get a working GitHub account! 



## What you need to do, if you join the challenge:
**You fork this repository.** 

0. Find a partner that you think you can relate to. Someone who can code or want to learn to code and someone you can communicate to.  
1. Then you both agree upon a level of algorithms you both will be working on. By level, I mean the level of difficulty. Do not choose a very hard level to begin with.   
2. **You both code for 1 hour daily on a different set of problem from any site you like.**  
3. After you both are done coding, you push it to this forked repository in directory that I have created, in a different file each day with the naming convention - "[NAME OF THE PERSON]-DAY-[Day NUMBER]". eg DHRUVAM-DAY-1.
4. Then you both check each other's code and try to understand and review what could have been done better.Try to review the coding styles, naming conventions, code coverage, code efficiency etc.
5. You both add in the comments what could have been better at the end of the file like I have done in this Readme file that you're reading right now with a **"REVIEW SECTION"** heading.
6. Also add a **"Today's New Lesson"** heading under which you both add anything you learnt today from anywhere around the world regarding code or algorithms or language.This will help you both to learn something new everyday and this new thing can be anything and as small as that "In java, the member variable boolean has a default value of false". It does not matter that something you came to know about is old or new. If it's new for you, you put that damn thing there!
7. **You and your partner, both challenge at least one other person on whatever social media platform you like with a hashtag  #OneCode21Day. Help the world grow with you!**
8. I have added two folder named "PartnerOneCodeInside" and "PartnerTwoCodeInside". You both keep your codes there for everyday with a naming convention that I have mentioned in point number: 3.
9. To push your code daily into the respective folders, you need to go through this, click [here](https://github.com/Roshanjossey/first-contributions). 
10. **Tweet or Instagram or Facebook Share your progress every day using the same hashtag **


### Why sharing the progress?
This is a good question. Sharing the progress lets you self-retrospect and you gain satisfaction. Each day you share, people know and we remove the feeling of competition. Our lives is too small to compete. Let's share and spread the love.
