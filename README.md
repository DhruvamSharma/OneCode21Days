# Challenge #OneCodeOneDay Accepted. 

### Why this challenge?


## What you need to do, if you join the challenge:
**You fork this repository.** 

0. Find a partner that you think you can relate to. Someone who can code or want to learn to code and someone you can communicate to.  
1. Then you both agree upon a level of algorithms you both will be working on. By level, I mean the level of difficulty. Do not choose a very hard level to begin with.   
2. **You both code for 1 hour daily on a different set of problem from any site you like.**  
3. After you both are done coding, you push it to this forked repository directory named **"CodeInside"** in a different file with the naming convention - "[NAME OF THE PERSON] DAY [Day NUMBER]". eg DHRUVAM-DAY-1.
4. Then you both check each other's code and try to understand and review what could have been done better.Try to review the coding styles, naming conventions, code coverage, code efficiency etc.
5. You both add in the comments what could have been better at the end of the file like I have done in this Readme file that you're reading right now with a **"REVIEW SECTION"** heading.
6. Also add a **"Today's New Lesson"** heading under which you both add anything you learnt today from anywhere around the world regarding code or algorithms or language.This will help you both to learn something new everyday and this new thing can be anything and as small as that "In java, the member variable boolean has a default value of false". It does not matter that something you came to know about is old or new. If it's new for you, you put that damn thing there!
7. **You and your partner, both challenge at least one other person on whatever social media platform you like with a hashtag  #OneCodeOneDay. Help the world grow with you!**
8. I have added two folder named "PartnerOneCodeInside" and "PartnerTwoCodeInside". You both keep your codes there for everyday with a naming convention that I have mentioned in point number: 3.
9. To push your code daily into the respective folders, you need to go through this, click [here](https://github.com/Roshanjossey/first-contributions).
10. **Tweet or Instagram or Facebook Share your progress every day using the same hashtag **
